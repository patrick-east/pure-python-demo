Python REST Client Demo 

Modules
-------

array_info    - Query for general array information and space usage.
                configuration properties of the target FlashArray.

hosts         - Create, delete, list, and connect host objects on the target
                FlashArray.

volumes       - Create, delete, and list volume objects on the target FlashArray.

health_check  - Build a very simple health report for the target array. This will
                check for some best practices for host connections as well as
                alerts and messages on the FlashArray.


Usage
-----

Each module can be run as a standalone executable, or imported and used as a
helper by larger scripts. Run "<module>.py --help" for more information.

There is a health_check.py that demonstrates combining them together an doing
more advanced usage of the Python REST Client.

Each module requires a --target (/-t), --username (/-u), and --password (/-p)
parameter for connecting to a FlashArray via the REST API.
